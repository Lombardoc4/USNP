# USNP - Native Plant Hub
The goal of this project is to provide a modern compressive source of education of Plant Biology as well as advocate exclusively for Native Plants to the United States.
## Past Tech
**Web2.0**
The USDA provides a slow and steady database to search plants and old school documentation. Although reading can be fun, these poorly styled sites with lengthy text don't really cut it for the modern reader who wants at most 140 characters per segment; a prime example is Twitter.

There are currently a plethora of other Web2.0 projects including [Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center](https://www.wildflower.org/) & [North Carolina Gardener Plant Toolbox](https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/). These two examples provide an average modern user interface; a nice nav, carousels, cards, etc. Both enjoyable databases to search through. North Carolina does an excellent job of organizing and categorizing the data in a very comprehensive manner.

**Mobile & Web**
The most modern way of currently working with plants is through photo identification. [PictureThis](https://plant.picturethisai.com/) a mobile application with a web database, provides never-ending insights on plants. As you're hiking, walking or sitting in the park you can instant gain endless knowledge of the plants surrounding you. They provide in-depth data even suggest why a plant may be wilting or it's leaves turning yellow.

## What's to come
**Education**
People want to know abundance of information, knowledge is power. There is a call to education, but we've all stepped away from the simple education of the our environment surrounding us. People would rather sign up and pay for a series of Hans Zimmerman 'coaching sessions' than go volunteer 2 hours at their local recreational facilities, picking up garbage _they_ accidentally littered weeks earlier.

The idea is to create a modern hub for teaching the youth about the biology of plants and the importance of native plants to our ecosystem. Simple lessons similar to doulingo, introducing simple concepts of how plants grow, from seed to seeding to dormancy. Challenging people to take care of their plants and giving them some sort of award system.

We want to empower adults curiosity in knowing what plants surround them, some may be in a for a big surprise that they don't have any native plants in their area.

**Nursery** (secondary goal)
This is a call to action to support the local nursery economy well of course
That's where the round-robin comes in, nurseries can use our _POS_ system to maintain their native plant catalog. Of course this can be installed on top of other common POS software. With this we can track inventory across the country and take Agriculture census data to find out what kind of plants are really sold in the US. Something tells me we are promoting an abundance of ecological pest. Ever heard of the Great Chestnut Blight of the early 1900's. When was the last time you had chestnuts roasting by the open fire?

Bringing this back to full circle on education the youth and intriguing the adults, contributing to the natural order of the world.


TL:DR; A plant database with a primary focus on fun education, leading to local nursery POS system integrations
